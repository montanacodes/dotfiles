JavaScript variables are-containers for data values|

Declaring a variable-const x = 5 (constant)
let y = 6 (changable)
var z = 7 (defunct)|

for loop-
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}|

WHILE LOOP-while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
var i = 1;
while (i < 6) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
};
console.log('Countdown finished!')|

ARRAY LITERAL SYNTAX-var train1 = ["wheat", "barley", "potato", "rocks"]|

Function SYNTAX-function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
|
Function parameters are listed- inside the parentheses () in the function definition.|

Function arguments are- the values received by the function when it is invoked.|

Calling a function-let x = myFunction(4, 3);   
// Function is called, return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;             
}
// Function returns the product of a and b|

an object consists of key-value pairs, known as -properties.â€‹|
We can add new key-value pairs to existing objects using the-dot notation. |

If the function is a property of an object-it is then referred to as a method.|

A function of a declared variable looks like-
var car = {};

car.color = "red";

car.turnKey = function() { 
  console.log('engine running'); 
}|

Arrays in Javascript are actually-just Objects
var test = typeof([1,2,3])|

Built in string method
search():- It is used to search a string for a specific value or an expression. It returns the position of the match.|
Built in string method
split():- It is used to split a string into an array of substrings.|
Built in string method
startsWith():- It is used to check whether a string begins with the specified characters.|
Built in string method
slice():- It is used to e2xtract a part of a string and return a new string.|
Built in string method
concat():- It is used to combine texts of two strings and return a new string.|
Built in string method
charAt():- It is used to return the character at the specified index.|
Built in string method
indexOf():- It is used to return the index, within the string object, which occurs first, of the specified value. It returns -1 if the object is not found.|
Built in string method
lastIndexOf():- It is used to return the index, within the string object, which occurs last, of the specified value. It returns -1 if the object is not found.|
Built in string method
match():- It is used to match a regular expression against a string.|
Built in string method
replace():- It is used to find a match between a regular expression and a string. The matched substring is replaced with a new substring.|
Built in string method
substr():- It is used to return the characters in a string, beginning at the specified location, through the specified number of characters.|
Built in string method
substring():- It is used to return the characters in a string between the two specified indexes.|
Built in string method
toLowerCase():- It is used to convert the string value which is called, to lower case.|
Built in string method
toUpperCase():- It is used to convert the string value which is called, to upper case.|
Built in string method
valueOf():- It is used to return the primitive value of the specified object|

User defined string method
logIt():- It is used to log a parameter back to the console, when the code is executed.|
User defined string method
return():- It is used to return a specific value, explicitly.|
